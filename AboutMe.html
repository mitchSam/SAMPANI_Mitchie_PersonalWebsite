          <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I Ma.Mitchie Sampani liked reading, specially wattpad series. I love being with my friends, spending time with them, going out with them releases my stress. I am also part of a small group in our baranggay that helps me grow more as a person specially being a teen ager, in their I learned how to socialize to some sort of new people, engage into different kind of activities held. Every year I guessed I am gaining friends which I really like much, I also talk a lot, but most of the time my friends make fun of me but somehow I'm used to it, coz I know for myself none of those were true. </p>
